The complexity of Stack<T>::clear() is O(N). My clear function is pretty simple, as it simply calls the clear() function of the STL vector class used to implement my Stack class. That said, STL vector class' clear() function is of linear complexity, making it O(N) for as many as N elements in the vector.
